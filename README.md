# world-population-analysis

I used kaggle.com to get data for the world population since 1970. The data is based
on the UN database, where the total population is estimated to be 7.7 billion. The
dataset itself contains 17 columns indicating several facts besides population in
different periods, such as the country name or the density per square kilometer

My graphs show various analyses with the source code,
including world population growth since 1970, the world population percentage of
the top 10 countries, the top 10 countries with the biggest population growth
throughout 1970-2020, and the 2022 population per country on an interactive map.
